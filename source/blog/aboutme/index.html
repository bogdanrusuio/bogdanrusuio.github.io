Hello everyone and welcome to my blog. I wanted to find a way to share topics that interest me and hopefully entertain at least one or two people out on the Internet (counting myself).

<p><img alt="This is me" src="/images/eu.jpg" width="140" height="140" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;"> I’m a thirty-something year old guy who lives in the Bucharest/Otopeni area. I’ve been here about 20 years but I grew up somewhere in SW of Romania.  </p>

The tasks I solve at work provide value to a company which in turn compensates me. That compensation enables me to do the things I’m passionate or curious about. I enjoy writing about and sharing the things that interest me the most.
My interests vary widely; I’ll narrow in on the things I’m most interested in.
